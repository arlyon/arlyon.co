I define success as a human being as having a set of well-grounded invariants,
always doing your best to strive for them, but continuously challenging them.
A successful human being will fight to defend their invariants with all the
energy they until have the precise moment they are presented with a better
alternative.

> Right now my main focuses are dating and relationships. Not falling in love,
  but understanding what attraction is and learning about it. Having always 
  had a stable relationship, I've never had that kind of emotional stress, 
  and I think it will be good for me.
  
This page has some core tenets, followed by a number of invariants that go
into more detail in all aspects of life. The 10 core invariants are the most 
important, while the more specific ones are situational, and better for 
consulting when the time comes (ie before a date, or after an argument with 
a loved one).
  
## Table of Contents

{{< tableofcontents >}}

## Aspirations
 
- to deny my illness any purchase on my quality of life. this is achieved by
  constant exercise, healthy eating, and hard work. it will pay off.
- to truly master my chosen craft, whether that is through a business, 
  engineering, or something else.
- to become financially independent and retire early.
- to see the world and experience all it has to offer.
- to build a happy family.

## Weaknesses
 
- you are complacent. your ability to see the joy in anything makes it very easy to
  come up with reasons why this is good enough. you can do better.
- you are subconsciously agreeable. being stoic is not being a pushover, and you
  should not try to agree with everyone.
- you struggle to build attachment. you can quickly make good friends, are funny, 
  respectable, but rarely miss people or worry if you are away from them. always 
  be aware of (and compensate for) this.

## Core Invariants

The core values are the main loop of a human being. They embody what a strong
and healthy human should always have (consciously or sub-consciously) in the
back of their mind. They are to be read every day.

**Be Present.** Look around. Appreciate what is around you. Complement her on
her necklace. Stop to watch the cat. Notice the architecture. [Favour observations 
over perceptions](https://www.diplateevo.com/perception-vs-observation/). 
Escape from reality is a bad thing.

**Evolve.** Learn from your mistakes. Publicize them. Mistakes can be mitigated,
but refusing to learn from them is irreparable. Favour rapid trial and error. 
Discomfort yields evolution. Avoid people with an aversion to change.

**Take Responsibility.** Excuses suspend disbelief and leads you into a
false sense of security. Alex you fall for this too much.

**Practice Humility.** You are not the best. At anything. Seek out those who
are. Find people that understand and counter your weaknesses. Have them be 
honest with you in beating them. Seek new perspectives.

**Act, Don't React.** No good comes from reaction. Separate yourself from the
problem and consider it in isolation. Act when the time is right. Decision 
making has two disjoint steps; observe, then decide.

**Be Antifragile.** Great people become stronger in times of distress. Remain
level-headed. Be the anchor. Be intolerant to problems, find their root cause, 
build a plan to address it, and push through.

**Be Radically Open Minded.** Say yes to new things. Kill your ego. [Know what
you don't know](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect).
Evidence first.

**Look for the good.** Assume good intentions. Find the silver lining.

**Prioritise.** You can have anything you want, but not everything you want.

**Make as much change as possible** in the areas you can influence. Completely 
ignore the areas you can't. Finish everything you start. Put your phone down.

## Relationships

These invariants apply to both platonic and romantic relationships. They provide
a framework to lead an honest, social, and respected lifestyle. Successful 
relationships are built on respect, attraction, or both.

### Building Respect

- stay honest and transparent
- be more invested in yourself than in others' opinions of yourself. when you derive your
  self-worth from others, they will notice. if you work on yourself, people will come.
- money, looks, and fame don't matter. but they help. in order:
  - maintain hygiene
  - keep a strong posture
  - smile more
  - lift weights (and eat well)
- be confident in yourself:
  - look people in the eyes
  - remove the filter and say whatever comes to mind (focus instead on healthy thoughts)
  - unabashedly do the things you enjoy (as long as it does not bother others)
  - make (well-informed) opinions and respectfully vocalize them in detail.
  - speak louder, slower, more passionately, and minimize [speech disfluency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_disfluency).
  - use your chest voice when you speak. as a rule you should be able to pinch your nose
  and have no change in tonality.
- elicit emotion:
  - genuinely complement people
  - laugh, and make people laugh
  - open up your vulnerabilities
- be physical:
  - touch people
  - take up space
  - move around
- be unapologetically enthusiastic about your passions.
- be polarizing. most people respond positively, and those who don't aren't compatible.
  
### Building Attraction

- be genuine. do not compromise who you are. if you are having fun, people will come.
- do not try to impress. qualify her. set standards, stick to them.
- women are receptive, neutral, or unreceptive. you'll never sway the unreceptive.
- friction describes how easy it is to make women receptive. women with vastly
differing interests, lifestyle, and values are remarkably harder to attract. 
Alex, friction ended your last (7 year) relationship.
- understand abundance. there is always a bigger fish.
- only approach women you find attractive. anything else is needy.
- approach immediately. the longer you wait the harder it is.
- alcohol is a crutch.
- strike while the iron is hot.
- treat women like humans. attractive women get placed on a pedestal.
- rejection is good for you. eventually rejection will mean nothing.

### Dating

Find the right woman:

1. Uninstall tinder.
2. What values do I want in a woman? What traits do I rate highly? What deal-breakers do I have?
3. Where can I meet women similar to the ones I like?
4. What do I enjoy doing the most?
5. What events or organizations can I involve myself in?

~~Date~~ Polarize them: (work in progress)

- interactive activities. no cinema.
- set the context early. you are potential sexual partners. treat her like one.
- pursue genuine connection, not sex. intimacy is a result of connection (or promise of connection).
- keep it modestly priced, respectfully bail if needed.
- talk as little about yourself as possible. Alex you're shit at this.
- cold read. avoid interrogation by making assumptions.
- make the decisions. be in control of the plan. lead the girl.
- split date up into multiple parts. plan it out. have backups available.
- build (or maintain) sexual tension. Alex, this one may take some time, because after so many
  years it doesn't even occur to you.

### Love

- put things behind you. when we 'drop something', make sure it's done, or it 
  will pile up and there is no recovery. small problems that linger _will_ grow.
- address problems early, for much the same reasons.
- refuse to accept disrespect. above all else is respect. if someone is
  consistently disrespectful, end it immediately.
- it is always us versus the problem. someone who doesn't understand that is not worth your time.
- do not leave on bad terms. it will only make things worse.
- "winning" the argument has a cost: your relationship. one is important, one is not.

## Personal Life

These invariants apply to your personal life. They govern how you spend your time, what you
prioritise, and how you should act.

> Look to the patterns of those things that affect you in order to understand 
the cause-effect relationships that drive them and to learn principles for 
dealing with them effectively.

- take charge in your interests. become a leader in the things you enjoy.
- be generous with your time and wisdom. as soon as you are motivated only by the
  reward, you have lost.
- dance. all the time. in public. bob your head to the music. it always makes you feel better,
  and the confidence boost is invaluable.
- [satisfice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing), don't optimize. when you
  find a solution that meets your minimum criteria, immediately go for it. 
  optimizing will only leave you wanting what you don't have.
- surround yourself with honest and passionate people.
- knowledge is like velcro - install lots of “hooks” for new information to stick to, 
  and to allow associations to happen. be curious. read widely, outside your comfort zone.

## Professional Life

Under construction.

## Miscellaneous

- 80% of the work is accomplished in 20% of the time
- statistically, the best time to settle down is after you have met 40% of 
  your lifetime partners. If you want to settle down in 10 years, date and
  reject people for the first 4 years, then pick the next person who is better 
  than all the previous partners. ie. get rejected, *it's good for you.*
